1.Heap Implementation: to run the Python code for the heap implementation follow these steps:

1. **Save the Code:** Copy all the Python code provided in the 'Priority Queue Implementation using Heap and Scheduler Simulation' immersive and paste it into a new text file. Save this file with a `.py` extension (e.g., `heapImplementation.py`).
2. Use an IDE like VS Code or PyCharm.
3. **Install Dependency:** The code uses the `memory_profiler` library. If you don't have it installed, run the following command in your terminal: pip install memory_profiler
4. **Navigate to Directory:** Use the `cd` command in your terminal to navigate to the directory where you saved your `scheduler_simulation.py` file. For example, if you saved it in your 'Documents' folder:
5. **Run the Script:** Execute the Python script using 
command: python heapImplementation.py
The simulation output will then be displayed directly in your terminal.

2.HASHTABLE CHAINING: Instructions:
 Step 1: Set Up Your Environment
  - Use an IDE like VS Code or PyCharm
 Step 2: Put It All Together
   Save the following components in one .py file or code cell:
    - The Task class
    - The insert, extract_min, change_priority, is_empty functions
    - The _heapify_up and _heapify_down helpers
    - An empty list called heap to serve as your binary heap
